### Introduction
⚡My research focuses on understanding environmental hazards in cold regions influenced by climate change and human activities. I investigate permafrost degradation, active layer changes, geological hazards like surface subsidence, mining effects, and thermal thawing landslides. These factors impact critical infrastructure such as roads, railroads, and reservoirs. I utilize various methods, including RS, UAV, InSAR, GIS, signal processing, computational simulation, and machine learning.
