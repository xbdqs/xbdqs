## About me
🔭 I’m currently working as a postdoctor on the [Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.nieer.cas.cn/).

### Introduction
⚡My research focuses on understanding environmental hazards in cold regions influenced by climate change and human activities. I investigate permafrost degradation, active layer changes, geological hazards like surface subsidence, mining effects, and thermal thawing landslides. These factors impact critical infrastructure such as roads, railroads, and reservoirs. I utilize various methods, including RS, UAV, InSAR, GIS, signal processing, computational simulation, and machine learning.
### Disciplines
🌱Remote Sensing; Geoinformatics (GIS); Geography; Civil Engineering; Environmental Engineering.
### Skills and expertise
👯Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; Permafrost; Remote Monitoring; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; GIS Application; Remote Sensing; GIS Analysis; GIS Mapping; Remote Sensing Technology; Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR).
### Languages
😄Mandarin Chinese; English.
